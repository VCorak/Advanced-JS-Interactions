- Duration: `3 days`


## The Mission
Try to have all must have features for now. Remembering dang carousel gave me much of a headache at first time so let's see how will this go üòÜ

## Must-have features
- [x] A parallax carousel
  * it works on scroll and on mouse down-dragging feature which I did with few lines of JS-
    query selectors and event listeners on mouse down and mouse up and adding or removing 'active' class with classList method, just to check if mouse id down (true or false)
  * actually that went well this time, just lost a bit of time on this scroll snapping features for which I first taught that I have some error
    with this snapping thing after each color but it is actually easy resolvable. Still did not quite figure out why would anyone want that feature but ok... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
