## The Mission
Try to have all must have features for now. Remembering dang carousel gave me much of a headache at first time so let's see how will this go üòÜ

## Must-have features
- [x] A parallax carousel
  * it works on scroll and on mouse down-dragging feature which I did with few lines of JS-
    query selectors and event listeners on mouse down and mouse up and adding or removing 'active' class with classList method, just to check if mouse id down (true or false)
  * actually that went well this time, just lost a bit of time on this scroll snapping features for which I first taught that I have some error
    with this snapping thing after each color but it is actually easy resolvable. Still did not quite figure out why would anyone want that feature but ok... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

- [x] A collage with popup for more details
  * this was grueling...I did it few times in a row but in a wrong way, did not read the assigment right...Use a lot of help from all over internet,
  still am confused bout this appending children...at the end used Lightbox from ww3 school, started with Modals but that was not it bcs I had a lot of images with
    different ids so it was not great.
    * still not quite happy with alt position for the text on image bcs it is on the right side in the middle, not like at the bottom or top- have to fix that...
- [x] Hover image above every Pokemon in the text
  * this went ok, smooth, did it with just css
- [x] Functional chaser or runner circle
* still did not figure out why the chaser goes at some point at bottom middle and right side outside of box...üòï
* did not do runner yet -> **TO DO!!!**

## Nice-to-have features
- [x] Chaser AND runner circle are functional
  * runner still not done
- [x] Lightmode / Darkmode switch
- [x] Final letter challenge completed!
